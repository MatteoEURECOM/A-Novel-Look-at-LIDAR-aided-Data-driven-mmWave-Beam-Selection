## Dataset
In this work we use Raymobtime dataset, which is a collection of realistic ray-tracing data obtained by simulating traffic in environment highly inspired by real world data. It utilizes SUMO for mobility simulations, Insite for ray-tracing, Cadmapper and Open Street Map for importing realistic outdoor scenarios. The dataset is divided into smaller sets, with different frequencies considered, various number of receivers, and environments. We trained our models on the s008 dataset (we combined both training and validation subsets) and validated on s009.
